# LocalDeployer
Deploy fast and easily your applications to the local development IoT infrastructure

## How it works
Install the server tool to all your RaspberryPi (& co), make sure to start it when the raspberry Boot.
Install the client application on your development machine.

On your poroject just put a Deployment Descriptor in the project root like the following

File: ` DEPLOY-DESCRIPTOR.py `

Content:

```
PROJECT_NAME='My-awsome-project'
STARTUP_COMMAND='python helloworld.py'
SET_AS_STARTUP_APPLICATION=True
ON_DEPLOY_REBOOT=True
```
Note that the mandatory part in the deployment descriptor is just the PROJECT_NAME 

Now on your development machine, place yourself in the root folder of the project and type:

`localdeployer deploy`

All the local network available devices (where the server was installed) will be listed

```
$~ Availabe devices:
$~ 1) raspberrypigio2
$~ 2) raspberrypi5
$~ Type the device number where you wish to deploy
``` 

now just type the number of the device where you want to deploy your code and that's it. 

Have Fun!

Fell free to open issues, improve the code quality, add and propose features or whatever you have in your mind. 

## Disclaimer

This is a development only tool, use this just to test locally your own application without having to configure complex toolchain. I suggest you to use proper tools for your production environment.
